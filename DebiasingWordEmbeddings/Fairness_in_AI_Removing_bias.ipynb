    "$\\textbf{Abstract:}$ This report attempts to reproduce the word embedding debiasing algorithm and replicate experiments from Bolukbasi, Chang, Zou, Saligrama, and Kalai (2016). We adapt the publicly available implementation (https://github.com/tolga-b/debiaswe) and extend it with the soft debiasing method described in their paper. Several popular benchmarks are integrated in order to evaluate the word embeddings before and after debiasing. Besides replicating results on Word2vec, the effectiveness of the debiasing algorithms is investigated on GloVe and fastText embeddings. We show that the removal of direct bias for all the embeddings barely affects their expressiveness through a comparison of benchmark scores. However, we fail to reproduce large scale soft debiasing results as the method described by the authors is not realistically applicable."
